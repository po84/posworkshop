# Po's Personal Assistant

My attempt at having more control over my online personal data. Achieving this by implementing services I use myself piece by piece.

## Infrastructure

All data will be kept in a MySQL database. The system will use AWS for whatever AWS does.

## First step (My version of Google Keep)

Initially this is going to be just a shopping list. It shall have a web UI first, then mobile UI, android first, then maybe apple devices.
